# I Love That Song

The app helping music journalists organize the music and information they need for research. (In development.) Inspired by [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/), this full-CRUD app pulls from the Discogs API to return data on every album available in its database. "I Love That Song" was created as my General Assembly Unit 2 Project, building in one week a full-stack application from scratch using Node, Express, MongoDD, and Mongoose.
